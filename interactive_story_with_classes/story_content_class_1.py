            "emerald, and sapphire. Its eyes, deep pools of ancient wisdom, fix upon you with an intensity that is both unnerving and majestic. "
            "A plume of smoke drifts from its nostrils, and its wings, vast and powerful, unfurl with a grace that belies their strength. "
            "The dragon's presence is overwhelming, yet there is a sense of intelligence and curiosity in its gaze that suggests it is more than just a wild beast. ",

            "As you stand frozen, the dragon tilts its head, considering you with an almost discerning look. "
            "The air around you seems to vibrate with an unspoken understanding between two beings, thrown together by the whims of fate. "
